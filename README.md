# INTERSTELLAR
PROBLEM STATEMENT -

Space missions (Moon, Mars, deep-space) face two critical challenges:

Loss of Communication: Blocked line-of-sight, antenna failure, network congestion → Astronauts lose contact with Earth.

Orbital Threats to Satellites: Space debris, solar storms, orbital decay → Risk of collisions and satellite failures → Mission disruption.
